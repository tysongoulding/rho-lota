# rho

`rho` is a fast, clean, minimal coding-agent CLI built in Rust on Rig 0.42.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Start interactive REPL
rho

# Run one-shot prompt
rho -p "summarize this repository"

# Select model & provider
rho --provider anthropic --model claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
rho --provider openai --model gpt-4o

# Resume existing session
rho --resume <SESSION_ID>
```

## Interactive Editor and Footer

When both stdin and stdout are terminals, `rho` runs an interactive editor with
a two-line status footer pinned to the bottom of the terminal screen:

```text
agent output remains above in normal scrollback
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Write a message here; wrapped lines and explicit
newlines grow the editor upward.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
~/src/github.com/casonadams/rho (main)
↑6.9k ↓514 5.4%/128k @14.3t/s      qwen3.8:27b-mlx • high
```

The **top line** shows the working directory, git branch, and session name. The
**stats line** shows tokens sent (`↑`) and received (`↓`), cache reads/writes
(`R`/`W`), spend (`$`), context usage (`%/window`), and generation speed
(`@t/s`) as they become available, with the active model and thinking level
right-aligned. The activity spinner animates in-place on the working line while
the model is thinking or executing tools, keeping the footer stable and
preventing terminal jitter.

| Control       | Behavior                                                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter`       | Submit prompt.                                                               |
| `Shift+Enter` | Insert a newline without submitting.                                         |
| `Ctrl+J`      | Insert a newline, including in terminals that encode it as a raw line feed.  |
| `Alt+Enter`   | Submit with follow-up queueing.                                              |
| `Escape`      | Clear an idle draft, or cancel active execution and restore queued messages. |

Messages submitted while the agent is running enter a FIFO queue and execute in
order once the active turn settles.

## Core Built-in Tools

`rho` includes 6 native, robust built-in tools:

- `read`: Read file contents with line numbering, offset, and limit safeguards.
- `write`: Create or overwrite files (automatically creates parent directories).
- `edit`: Make precise file edits with exact text replacement.
- `bash`: Execute shell commands in the current working directory.
- `search`: Search the web and return structured summaries and URLs.
- `fetch`: Fetch and extract clean readable text or markdown from URLs.

| `cohere`       | API Key            | `COHERE_API_KEY` or `rho login cohere`           |
| `ollama-cloud` | API Key            | `OLLAMA_API_KEY` or `rho login ollama-cloud`     |
| `chatgpt`      | Subscription OAuth | `rho login chatgpt` (OAuth PKCE)                 |
| `copilot`      | Subscription OAuth | `rho login copilot` (GitHub device login)        |
| `local`        | Local Service      | `OLLAMA_HOST` (default `http://localhost:11434`) |

### Custom OpenAI-compatible providers

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint can be added at runtime via config — no rebuild.
In `~/.config/rho/config.toml` (or project `.rho/config.toml`):

```toml
[providers.acme]
base_url = "https://api.acme.dev/v1"   # your keys are sent here
key_env = "ACME_API_KEY"               # optional; falls back to ACME_API_KEY env or `rho login acme`
```

Then select it with `/model acme:<model>`. Names of built-in providers are
reserved. For security, `base_url` must use `http`/`https` and private or
loopback addresses are rejected unless `allow_private_network = true` in
config.toml.

Slash commands `/reload` (re-read config, skills, and MCP tools without losing
session history) and `/export [html|md] [path]` (write the active branch as a
readable artifact) work in the interactive REPL.

## Configuration & Skills (`~/.config/rho/`)

Global settings, credentials, state cache, skills, and instructions live under
`~/.config/rho` (override via `RHO_HOME`):

```text
~/.config/rho/
├── auth.json              # Stored API keys and OAuth tokens
├── state.json             # Cached last-used model & thinking level
├── config.toml            # Application settings
├── AGENTS.md              # Global default agent rules & instructions
└── skills/                # Global skills directory (SKILL.md files)
```

- **Instructions**: Discovers global `~/.config/rho/AGENTS.md` and workspace
  `./AGENTS.md`, `./CLAUDE.md`, or `./.cursorrules`.
- **Skills**: Declarative `SKILL.md` workflows resolved with precedence:
  1. Project `.rho/skills/` or `./skills/` (highest precedence, overrides user &
     built-in)
  2. User `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.config/rho/skills/`, or `~/.skills/`
  3. Embedded built-in skills (`create-plugin`, `plan`, `repo-agents-builder`,
     `spec`)

  Skills can be written as single flat markdown files (`skills/my-skill.md`) or
  structured directories (`skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` with optional supporting
  scripts/examples). Metadata (name, description, argument hints) is declared in
  YAML frontmatter. Invoke any skill in the REPL using `/skill:<name>` or
  `@<name>`.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Extensions

Extend `rho` with standard **MCP tool servers**:

```toml
# In ~/.config/rho/config.toml or .rho/config.toml
[mcp]
enabled = true

[mcp.servers.filesystem]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/username/Desktop"]
enabled = true

[mcp.servers.github]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
env = { GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN = "ghp_..." }
enabled = true
```

Tools exposed by MCP servers are automatically namespaced
(`filesystem_read_file`, `github_create_issue`, etc.) and presented to the model
as standard tools.

---

## Plugins & Lifecycle Hooks

Plugins hook into Rig's agent lifecycle (`tool_call`, `tool_result`,
`invalid_tool_call`, `completion_call`) to observe, steer, or augment execution:

```toml
# In ~/.config/rho/config.toml or .rho/config.toml
[plugins.permission]
enabled = true
command = "rho-plugin-permission"
```

- **[rho-plugin-permission](https://github.com/casonadams/rho-plugin-permission)**:
  Rule-based allow/deny checks in `~/.config/rho/permission.toml` plus
  interactive terminal approval modals.
- **Polyglot Daemons**: Write plugins in Rust, Python, Node.js, or Go via
  standard JSON-RPC 2.0 over standard I/O.
- **Official Rust SDK**: Build plugins in Rust with
  [`rho-plugin-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/rho-plugin-sdk).

Full hook protocol, Host UI services, and language examples are documented in
**[docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md)** and
**[examples/plugins/](examples/plugins/)**.

## Desktop Application (`lota`)

`rho` includes an official native desktop application frontend located in [`lota/`](lota/README.md), built on **Tauri 2.0**, **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

- **Prompt Composer**: Auto-expanding minimal composer with `@` mention autocomplete, `/` workflow actions, file/media drag-and-drop, and dynamic model/thinking budget selection.
- **Context Capacity & Compaction**: Live token telemetry and 100% full-capacity proportional memory diagnostics with on-demand compaction.
- **Morning Briefing Hub**: Aggregates Google/Microsoft Calendars, Gmail/Outlook inboxes, and Slack/Teams mentions into daily agenda synthesis.
- **Subagent Threads & Customisation Hub**: Dedicated isolated conversations for autonomous subagents and full management of Skills, MCP servers, and Rules.

---

## Architecture

The workspace is structured into clean, focused crates and frontends:

- **`rho-harness-core`**: Core domain logic, session DAG storage, configuration, token estimation, and presentation types.
- **`rho-engine`**: Native `rig.rs` agent runtime, provider factory, built-in tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `search`, `fetch`), and standard MCP client.
- **`rho-plugin-sdk`**: Lightweight SDK for building Rig-native plugins and lifecycle hooks.
- **`rho`**: Binary CLI entrypoint, interactive TUI editor, slash commands, and terminal rendering engine.
- **`lota`**: Tauri 2.0 native desktop GUI application with real-time streaming, diff inspections, and workspace management.
